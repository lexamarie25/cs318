    There are Toppers Pizza franchises throughout the Midwestern United States.The chain includes both company-owned locations and franchise stores. It has more than 70 locations in the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, Nebraska, Michigan, Texas and Wisconsin. The chain's target market is college students and other customers between 18 and 34 years old. As part of its targeting of college students, most of the chain's stores remain open until 3:00 a.m. or later to accommodate late-night business.

    Toppers founder Scott Gittrich entered the pizza business in 1984 when he was a college student at the University of Illinois and took a job as a Domino's Pizza delivery driver. He rose through the company, serving as director of operations for a group of 22 franchise locations in Charlotte, North Carolina, when he left in 1991 to start his own pizza business

    Originally called "Topper's Pizza", the chain removed the apostrophe from its name as part of its marketing strategy to give it a more informal image
