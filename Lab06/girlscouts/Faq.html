<h3>How old do girls have to be to go out hiking?</h3>
    </div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Girls can hike whenever they feel ready. It's similar to taking a walk, going by foot to the local store for milk, or going from shop to shop at the mall. A hike is a longer walk, with a purposeâ€”whether following a trail you have selected or reaching a special destination. A hike is planned with your troop/group, supervised by adults, and a group first-aid kit is carried by the first-aider. Longer hikes usually involve daypacks with lunch or snacks, water, and rain gear. A hike might be a mile or two in a nearby park or at a camp, or five or six miles in a state park. Start out with shorter hikes and build up to longer hikes.</p>

<h3>What does ACA accreditation mean?</h3>
    </div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Girl Scout councils can choose to belong to the American Camp Association (ACA). ACA accreditation means that the camp practices have been measured against national standards and go a step beyond a state's basic licensing requirements. However, all Girl Scout camps are given activity and program recommendations and standards through Girl Scouts of the USA. Councils are encouraged to belong to ACA, but membership and accreditation are not required as there are additional fees involved.</p>

<h3>What kinds of activities do you do at resident camp?</h3>
    </div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Camp is a great place to have fun, meet new friends, and learn new skills. At Girl Scout camp you might learn to swim, ride a horse, make a clay pot, groom a llama, paddle a canoe, go on a hike, learn how to create a new computer program or use a global positioning system, make jewelry, or learn about the plants and animals in the area. Camp is a place where you learn to live and work with other girls, and prepare for the challenges of every day life. Many camps have special themes for each session, but there is always an element of girl planning. Ask for camp information from your local Girl Scout council.</p>
